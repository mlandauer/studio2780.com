        <h2>What is coworking?</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking">Coworking is an international movement</a> that provides a model for establishing and managing creative work spaces.
          It is a member based culture for creative professionals that brings individuals together to work in a shared space.
          The space is arranged so that people can work by themselves and is also designed to enable collaborations between our
          members.  Whether you’re a work-at-home professional, or freelancing, if you have struck out on your own
          and are missing out on the good bits of working in creative company, the conversations, inspiration, or collaborations,
          then coworking might just be right for you.  2780 works to provide its members with all of the benefits of working
          for a creative company with the advantages of working independently.
        </p>
        <h2>It's not about the big bucks</h2>
        <p>
          This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_enterprise">social
          enterprise</a>, meaning it is for purpose rather than for profit, so there’s no faceless company making a mint
          from the rent.
        </p>
          <p>
          The annual membership fee shows us you're serious and helps towards getting the place set up and the weekly rent covers the running cost of the space.
